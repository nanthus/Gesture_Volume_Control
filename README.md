# Gesture_Volume_Control
This is my new project called "GESTURE VOLUME  CONTROL". It is used to control the volume of our computer, using hand gestures. We can increase and decrease volume using hand gestures. This is done with the help of "MediaPipe" framework , "pycaw" libraries and "Hand Tracking Module"..
